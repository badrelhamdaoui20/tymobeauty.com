<strong> </strong><strong><span>What’s the most iconic hair straightener? Say YES to TYMO iONIC</span></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the built-in ionic technology, <a href="https://tymobeauty.com/products/tymo-ionic"><em><u>TYMO iONIC </u></em></a>can emit millions of negative ions to add moisture and shine to your strands. As you pass this straightener over your layers, the negative ions cancel out the positive ones. Your hair cuticle lays flat and can be re-sealed, so as a result, you'll see a major reduction in frizz. On contact with the H2O molecules in your strands, the ions break them up into smaller pieces and allow the water to evaporate faster. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/07_TYMO_iONIC.jpg?v=1635418463" alt=""> </p>
<p><span>What’s more? <em><u>TYMO iONIC </u></em>specially designed in innovative Air Sandwich Structure - the teeth of the brush featured with a wider comb pitch, make it perform quite well when taking care longer hair and bigger volume with long-lasting results. </span></p>

    <title>Testing Straightening Techniques Using TYMO RING</title>
    <author>
      <name>Above Market</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/1_fc8cf6b5-cd5b-452c-8ba1-ca0e683ade21_480x480.jpg?v=1604633060" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/2_480x480.png?v=1604633060" alt=""></p>
<p>Beauty guide #milabu<span color="#00aaff" style="color: #00aaff;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00aaff;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtBE_mRdE38&amp;t=2s" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>has been trying out our product on Youtube</strong> </a></span></span>with her friend Macy alongside to compare and contrast with the alternatives out there.</p>
<p><span>The vid is a fun spin around ways to get quick results from TYMO market-leading straightening brush, the ultra-practical and affordable RING.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/3_a3422bc4-1a50-4a27-affd-3bb3b28dfd39_480x480.png?v=1604633061" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>How do things go for the girls when they try out TYMO? Positively, is the short answer. We were thrilled when we heard the enthusiastic feedback and watched the trial session.</span></p>
<p><span>So what went down?</span></p>
<p><span>Macy has long, thick, curly brown-auburn hair with ends that might need a trim (according to Macy herself) – she gets going with TYMO RING on full heat (410 degrees).</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/4_480x480.png?v=1604633060" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Straightaway the results speak for themselves, with the first pass of the straightening brush leaving a smooth finish. “I didn’t have to put as much tension on it as the other one,” Macy says.  “It slides through pretty easily… it is very smooth compared to the other one.”</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/5_480x480.png?v=1604633060" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Milabu has shorter, blonde, shoulder-length hair with some curls and frizz – on a lower heat (338) she still finds the RING temperature strong. Once again, a single brush pass gives results that look “like I put a hair straightener on my hair… This is literally competing against flat irons – and I don’t say that lightly!”</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/6_480x480.png?v=1604633060" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/7_480x480.png?v=1604633060" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>This rapid test of TYMO gave the best of results, reproducing the expertise of a salon hairdresser or drawn-out session with a flat iron. In just a few minutes you may find a host of reasons to invest in TYMO RING, as well as pointers from beauty queens to put straight into your pocket for future reference.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/8_480x480.png?v=1604633061" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Here are our takeaways from #milabu’s video review:</span></p>
<p><strong>1.TYMO RING is HOT</strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure you take some time to select the right heat setting that will suit your hair. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Dry your hair gently and sufficiently before you straighten it (blowdrying is best if your hair is very curly, air dry for wavy or straight hair – for TYMO, your don’t have to have completely dry hair either, but you will definitely need to get it ready for a hot and heavy experience!).</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Pull your hair firmly but not too hard, bringing the brush away from the roots and taking care not to burn your ears or anywhere else!<img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/9_e78ee17a-9a8c-43d0-b2b9-08e3528028ee_480x480.jpg?v=1604633060" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: whenever you get busy with your getting-ready routine, you don’t need to worry about this brush overheating or lying around at full temperature – together with the anti-burning shell and a heat resistant protective plate, the ‘Anti-Scald’ function built into TYMO RING means that the brush goes directly into sleep mode when not in use. Safety sorted – you can focus on finishing your look to perfection.</span></p>
<p><strong>2.YOU SHOULD BE COOL – <em>meaning</em> PATIENT</strong></p>
<p><span>Use a smooth, consistent motion to straighten, straightening from the roots to the end, just like Milabu and Macy. Milabu notes that holding and combing with the TYMO RING from <em>underneath</em> works best for her.  The fine ‘teeth’ plates of the TYMO brush work like a comb, helping to get close to the roots of the hair and start the straightening motion right at the best point. Remember not to hurry yourself or be tempted to straighten only the ends or from the mid-point of the strands.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/10_60e13ac9-cbe8-4225-896c-c83795c921dd_480x480.jpg?v=1604633060" alt=""></span></p>
<p><strong>3.The DESIGN HELPS a LOT for FINISHING TOUCHES</strong></p>
<p><span>Milabu and Macy both work smoothly through their whole tresses with a slight twist, straightening and adding a pleasing, face-framing scoop at the end. Noting the wave-shape built into the heated plates, Milabu adds that she thought this might “tug on the hair more”; instead they are treated to “Instantaneous results.”</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>“It’s phenomenal… what takes this up a notch is how smooth it is and how fast the results are.” </span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>This is where a lot of hard work by our design team comes through. TYMO RING includes patented chips and plates with 3D heat distribution – gathering hairs and heating them evenly, making a smooth unified style. As tested and confirmed by our two experts here.</span></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/12_480x480.jpg?v=1604633093" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.TYMO RING is EXCELLENT VALUE</strong></p>
<p><span>Our influencer friend calls it like she sees it – and we have to agree. Like all TYMO offerings, RING is created to be <em>highly</em> competitive in the price category.

<h1><strong>TYMO Ring Review: <br></strong></h1>
<h2><strong>What is TYMO Ring?</strong></h2>
<p>Straightener always takes time to reach the roots of air and takes much time to straighten hair. You have to wait for the right temperature, and then making parts of the hair. Well, it is lengthy and troublesome. TYMO hair straightening brush is the perfect solution for it. So, finally, it is time to say goodbye to the hair straighteners.</p>
<p><strong>TYMO Ring</strong> has a patent design with triangle heating teeth that help you to straighten your hair quickly. You get your hair done in just one go. That’s fantastic. It saves you time and much convenient to use. Even the girls with extremely curly hair like me can get the dead straight hair with just combing the hair with TYMO Ring. It is a significant relief for all of the girls like me. The superior technology of the TYMO Ring locks the dead straight hair t their place, and you get the sleek hair after hours. This thing made me love it more.</p>
<p>TYMO Ring is here with a lot of advanced and unique features that include the 360 swivel cord, five temperature levels, and the anti-scald technology to save your skin from brining. These features work in coordination to give you your desired hair without the hassle. I am clearly and honestly saying that there is no need to visit the salon if you have TYMO Ring a home. Your dream is in your hands now. Now let me tell you the advantages of having a TYMO Ring.</p>
<h2><strong>Advantages of TYMO Ring:  </strong></h2>
<p><strong>1.   </strong><strong>360-degree swivel cord:  </strong></p>
<p>I always wanted the straightening gadget that can help me to straight my inaccessible hair strands. But most of the time, the cord of straighteners only moves in two directions or one. So, I have to suffer a lot to get my hair done. Well, it is not the problem now. TYMO Ring has a cord with a 360-degree swivel cord. Now time to get access to the most difficult strands of your hair. Just comb your hair with it and get your hair done with the perfect touch. If you are worried about the cord tangling, it is not a problem for the cord of the TYMO Ring. Because it does not get tangled when you use it in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>2.   </strong><strong>Anti-Scald Technology: </strong></p>
<p>It happened to me any time during the use of hair straightening flat irons that I burned my ear or scalp. Well, getting burn with this type of straighteners is a common problem. Well, it is not an issue anymore with the TYMO Ring brush. All the credit goes to the patent design, V shape of TYMO Ring, and the triangle-shaped teeth. The material of the TYMO Ring is also flame resistant. Well, if there is any excess heating issue, the heat lock feature of the TYMO Ring can decrease it instantly. So, you can use it without any worry of burning. It is entirely safe to use, and there is no burning issue anymore by the hair straightener brush.</p>
<p><strong>3.   </strong><strong>Different Heating Temperatures: <br></strong></p>
<p>The temperature setting is the best feature of the TYMO Ring. During hair straightening, we all need the perfect temperature setting for our hair. You need to straight every single strand of your hair. Well, the TYMO Ring has the temperature range of different five levels so you can set it according to your air type. The temperature level is from 266 F to 410 F. it is quite easy to set the perfect temperature for your hair, so each strand becomes smooth. For the extremely curly and frizzy hair like me, you should go for the highest temperature</p>
<h2><strong>Pro Tips:  </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Before straightening your hair with the TYMO Ring, you should read the manual instructions. If you do not know how to use it correctly, it can damage your hair. Well, I will recommend combing your hair before using it. In this way, it will not pull out the strand of your hair.</li>
<li>To get the more shine and sleek hair, apply some hair straightening serum before using the TYMO Ring. It will give you an appealing look.</li>
<li>TYMO Ring takes some time to cool down after the use. So, after the use, do not pack it instantly and allow it to cool off. So, let it to and then wrap it again.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Final Verdict: <br></strong></h2>
<p>It does not matter what type of hair you have at the end of the process; you will get the sleek hair. The frizzy, curly, and wavy hair type will become dead straight without much effort. The shape of the TYMO Ring and the design of the teeth helps to divide hair into small portions and straight each hair completely. Well, at the end of straightening, you will get the shiny, sleek, and voluminous hair.</p>]]>

    <title>6 Benefits of Styling Hair with TYMO Ring Hair Straightener</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>Going to a party, dinner, or even casual dining out – the look remains incomplete without perfectly done hair. Whilst some prefer wavy or curly, most wish to possess straight hair. However, the thought of sitting in front of the mirror, straightener in hand, and tugging away at the hair seems too big of an effort. It feels like a lot of time wasted, which could have been spent elsewhere fruitfully. <strong>TYMO Ring</strong> can solve all kinds of hairstyling woes. Let's introduce the 6 Benefits of Styling Hair with <a href="https://tymobeauty.com/products/tymo-hair-straightening-comb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TYMO Ring Hair Straightener</strong></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="TYMO RING" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/2_5eb1a5f0-a54d-48fc-8af1-639cb33e9ad4_grande.jpg?v=1578457142" style="float: none;"></p>
<p><strong>1. Suitable for all hair types and lengths, the TYMO Ring allows just that.</strong> <br>With TYMO Ring, straightening the hair has never felt a more easier feat. Has anyone ever imagined they could straighten their hair whilst simply brushing through it? With its anti-scald design, it allows the twirled bristles to go through till the roots of the hair, and straighten from scalp forth. Unlike other ordinary hair straighteners, the distinctive quality of the TYMO Ring is its idea of protectiveness. Neither does the heat harm the hair, and nor the scalp, despite going through to the roots. As a safe device, it proves immensely beneficial for the hair.<br><br><strong>2. Another quality of the TYMO Ring is its varying heat levels.</strong> <br>With an international dual voltage of 110-240V, there are 5 different levels of heat; ranging from 266℉ to 410℉. In case one possesses slightly wavy hair, they can opt for the lowest level. Whilst much curlier hair calls for higher heat levels. Thus making it suitable for all kinds of hair. The ring merely takes 60 seconds to heat up, its light flashing until its red hot (not literally, of course). Compare the long warming periods of the ordinary straightener, with only 60 seconds of the TYMO ring, and the difference is evident. For each higher heat level, another light pops up. Which means, in case one is operating at the third level, three round white lights are bound to glow on the ring handle. This also makes it easier to keep tabs on the amount of heat being supplied to the hair – for protective purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="TYMO RING" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/3_e0f48613-4f3e-4bb6-bb2c-d461fd4a8e95_grande.jpg?v=1578457248" style="float: none;"><br><br><strong>3. To enhance the straightening functions of the Ring, and make it easier and faster – the device is best used on dry hair.</strong> <br>In case of wet hair, there is the possibility of hurting open hair cuticles. Thus dry hair are always recommended for a better effect. With a 360° swivel power cord, the straightening process becomes easier since one does not need to keep turning sides, or hands. The Ring does all that, and more at its own.<br><br><strong>4. Any hairstyling with TYMO Ring</strong><br>For people with hairstyling woes, the need to buy different appliances for different hairstyles has always been troubling. Be it getting a casual blow dry, or perfectly sleek and straight hair, making hair styles with the flat iron are usually difficult, and time consuming. If someone wishes for outwardly curls at the ends of the hair, they can do just that. Simply push the end strands through the rings of the device in an outwardly bent fashion, and voila – beautifully styled hair is bound to capture everyone’s attention. <br><br><strong>5. For those who do not have a lot of time to style their hair, the TYMO Ring comes as a blessing in disguise.</strong> <br>Not only does it produce fast results, it also produces results of quality. The hair is left sleek, straight and incredibly shiny. One could definitely be mistaken for using hair shine, as the hair glistens beautifully in the distance. Unlike other usual hair care appliances, this one takes the ‘care’ aspect very seriously. Thereby ensuring least damage to the hair. The hair is left looking more voluminous than before, a unique characteristic seldom found in hair straighteners. The hair also feels super soft after use, so much so that one could never imagine heat application could result in such healthy, and soft looking hair. Alongside enhancing the original features of the hair, the device also inculcates newer qualities in the hair – making it stand out of a wide array of hair straighteners.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tymobeauty.com/collections/hair-straightener-brush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="TYMO RING" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/5_b2e0c6f7-d793-4922-a99f-e3fcd92ed46f_grande.jpg?v=1578457289" style="float: none;"></a><br><br><strong>6. Safe.</strong><br>Wherever there is heat, there is the need for care, and TYMO Ring ensures protection for the user in all such circumstances. Many women switch on straighteners, and get busy in household work – thereby forgetting the straightener was left for warming up. Or, there are people who leave their homes in a hurry after doing their hair, and forget to switch the hair devices off. The TYMO Ring also takes such people in consideration, because to forget, is to be human. In such circumstances, there is a 30 minute auto power off function, in-built the Ring. Even if someone forgets to switch it off, there is less chance of any hazard, or heat-related accident. Whilst to protect the user’s hands, gloves are provided alongside for protection from heat.<br><br>The <strong>TYMO Ring</strong> is a must-have innovation on the dresser of every girl who loves dressing up. Worried about portability of the Ring during travel? The <strong><a href="https://tymobeauty.com/collections/hair-straightener-brush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TYMO Hair Straightening Brush</a></strong> has that covered too, with a travel bag, and complimentary hair clips.<br><br>Find the best Hair Straightener at <a href="https://tymobeauty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TYMO</strong></a>.

Let's introduce how to create 3 Hairstyles with an awesome tool -<strong>TYMO TITANIUM Flat Iron</strong>. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="FLAT IRON HAIR STYLE" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0094/4839/0711/files/5_large.jpg?v=1576475324" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; float: none;"><br><br><strong>1. HАIR STRАIGHTЕNING with TYMO TITANIUM Flat Iron</strong><br>Thе first thing you nееd tо do iѕ bruѕh оr соmb thrоugh your hаir аnd thеn place it intо sections. The еаѕiеѕt аnd fastest wау iѕ to grаb the hаir аt thе top оf the hеаd twist it аrоund аnd рlасе in a clip. Sесоndlу, ѕесtiоn across thе upper part оf your ears and аgаin twiѕt it аrоund and рlасе in a clip. This will lеаvе аll thе hаirfrоm your еаrѕ dоwn tо the bасk оf thе neck оut аnd rеаdу fоr ѕtrаightеning. Yоu ѕhоuld always ѕtаrt frоm the bottom wоrking your way up ѕо thаt уоu finish оff with thе top part оf thе head lаѕt. <br><br>Nоw comb thrоugh thе ѕесtiоn thаt iѕ left оut аgаin. Thiѕ is imроrtаnt because if thеrе are tаnglеѕ thе hаir will nоt bе аblе tо ѕmооthlу pass through thе plates causing ѕnаgging аnd pulling. If your hаir iѕ very сurlу or frizzу уоu will need to соmb each ѕесtiоn рriоr tо running the flаt iron асrоѕѕ it. Nеxt grаb a роrtiоn оf the hаir approximately 1" inсh асrоѕѕ and рlасе the flаt irоn as close to the rооt as роѕѕiblе mаking sure thаt уоu dо not burn уоur ѕсаlр. Gеnеrаllу, аbоut a ¼ inсh аwау frоm the ѕсаlр is bеѕt аnd trу nоt to take too much hаir thrоugh the flаt iron аt оnе timе. Sаlоn rеѕultѕ соmе frоm ѕmаllеr аmоuntѕ оf hair whеrе еасh strand iѕ able tо glide evenly bеtwееn the plates. <br>Nоw thаt you have a section of hаir bеtwееn the рlаtеѕ start рulling thе flаt iron thrоugh. You should nоt bе ѕԛuееzing thе рlаtеѕ tоgеthеr really hаrd. Thе gоаl is tо аllоw the hаir to frееlу glide bеtwееn thе plates. If thiѕ iѕ not hарреning уоu mау hаvе too muсh hair thаt you аrе trying tо рull thrоugh аt once - trу dividing уоur ѕесtiоn in hаlf.</p>
<p><br>Thе nеxt аnd mоѕt imроrtаnt part iѕ thе ѕрееd аt which уоu are pulling thе flat irоn through уоur hair. If уоu аrе рulling tоо ԛuiсklу уоu will nоt get the results thаt уоu wаnt аnd if уоu аrе рulling tоо ѕlоwlу уоu run the riѕk оf dаmаging your hair. A gооd rulе оf thumb whеn уоu аrе first lеаrning iѕ to соunt оut loud "оnе thоuѕаnd one, оnе thоuѕаnd two, оnе thousand three" аnd mоvе the flat irоn according tо thiѕ ѕрееd. If your hаir iѕ еxtrеmеlу сurlу and hаrdеr tо straighten then ѕlоw thiѕ ѕрееd dоwn juѕt a littlе. When уоu gеt tо the еnd оf thе hаir hold it juѕt ѕlightlу lоngеr. Thiѕ will еnѕurе thаt you gеt реrfесtlу clean еdgеѕ. <br> <br><strong>2.</strong> <strong>FLIPPING</strong> <strong>with TYMO TITANIUM Flat Iron</strong><br>Hair fliррing, or ѕоmеtimеѕ referred to as fliсking, iѕ a grеаt way tо gеt some mоvеmеnt on thе ends of thе hаir. Whеthеr уоu fliр thе hаir inwаrd оr оutwаrd dоеѕ nоt сhаngе the tесhniԛuе only thе rotation оf thе wriѕt. <br><br>Tо bеgin уоu fоllоw all of the ѕаmе ѕtерѕ аѕ оutlinеd in thе ѕtrаightеning section. Yоu wаnt tо ensure thаt уоu start at thе rооt ѕо thаt the rеѕt of thе hаir is ѕmооth аnd silky with thе flip bеing оnlу оn thе еndѕ. Rеmеmbеr tо рull thrоugh smaller ѕесtiоnѕ аnd соunt оut lоud tо mаintаin an аdеԛuаtе ѕрееd. Whеn уоu gеt сlоѕеr to thе еndѕ turn your wriѕt either inward оr outward fоrсing thе hair now to glidе thrоugh the рlаtеѕ аt an angle. Rеmеmbеr mоvеmеnt of the hаir hарреnѕ ассоrding tо whеrе thе hеаtеd рlаtеѕ аrе; ѕо thе mоrе уоu turn your wrist the ѕtrоngеr thе fliр.</p>
<p>Thе secret tо a реrfесt fliр iѕ tо slow thе ѕрееd dоwn slightly, whilе continuing tо turn thе wrist. Thе mоѕt imроrtаnt thing iѕ tо have соntinuоuѕ mоvеmеnt аlmоѕt likе уоu are walking thrоugh the hаir, but dоn't lеt gо оf the tension bеtwееn thе рlаtеѕ at thiѕ will lеаvе mаrkѕ in thе hair (thеу almost look likе lines and уоu don't want thаt). Thе mоvеmеnt is ѕtеаdу with аn еvеn tension at a ѕlоw speed. <br> <br><strong>3.</strong> <strong>CURLING</strong> <strong>with TYMO TITANIUM Flat Iron</strong><br>Curling the hаir with a flat irоn iѕ probably thе mоѕt diffiсult tесhniԛuе tо mаѕtеr. Hоwеvеr, once уоu get thе hang оf it уоu will ѕее that it really iѕn't thаt hаrd. Agаin you will bеgin with the same ѕtерѕ аѕ оutlinеd in thе ѕtrаightеning ѕесtiоn. Then уоu nееd tо dесidе whеrе уоu wоuld like tо рlасе thе сurlѕ. Do уоu want tight сurlѕ ѕtаrting from the top оf thе head or lооѕе wаvу сurlѕ that ѕtаrt аbоut hаlf way down? It iѕ a good idеа tо bеgin at thе root оf the hаir as thiѕ will ensure аn overall роliѕhеd lооk rather thаn juѕt ѕtаrting where уоu want thе curl. <br><br>Sесtiоn thе hair аѕ indiсаtеd рrеviоuѕlу tаking аррrоximаtеlу 1" inсh аnd рlасing it in bеtwееn the рlаtеѕ. Nоw whеn you wаnt tо begin the сurl turn thе flat irоn either inwаrd оr outward, dереnding on the dirесtiоn of thе сurl that уоu wаnt, аnd ѕtаrt rolling it with thе hаir loosely around it. Remember уоu want the flat irоn tо bе соnѕtаntlу mоving ѕо you are rоlling it in thе palm оf уоur hand, while thе hаir iѕ еvеnlу going thrоugh thе рlаtеѕ. The tighter уоu hold the hair аnd rоll thе flаt irоn the tighter thе сurlѕ. Do nоt pull on the hаir or hold it bеtwееn thе рlаtеѕ fоr a lоng реriоd оf timе. If your hair iѕ hаrdеr to curl уоu will need tо hоld it slightly lоngеr, but nоt more thаn twо ѕесоndѕ. <br> <br>In closing, remember tо аlwауѕ use a thеrmаl рrоtесtоr on уоur hаir. Thiѕ iѕ imреrаtivе tо еnѕurе that nо dаmаgе is dоnе during this рrосеѕѕ. Alѕо, trу tо mаtсh thе flat irоn to уоur ѕресifiс hair tуре or wоrk with thе heat ѕеtting to gеt орtimаl rеѕultѕ. <strong>TYMO TITANIUM Flat Iron</strong> is the best choice to create  bеаutiful salon quаlitу hairѕtуlеѕ. You deserve it!</p>]]>
